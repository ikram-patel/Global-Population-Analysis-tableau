<h1>GLOBAL POPULATION ANALYSIS</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my data analysis and visualization project centered around Global Population Analysis. This project aims to provide a comprehensive and visually intuitive understanding of the Global population data of 234 countries world wide starting from the year 1980 till 2023 and forecasting it till 2050.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The primary objective was to shed light on the growth and spread of the global population by building interactive and visually appealing visualizations using Tableau. Population growth plays a critical role in urban planning, policymaking, resource allocation, and more. Over the course of history, there has been a significant increase in the global population, influenced by various factors such as migration trends, socioeconomic advancements, and mortality and birth rates. Through visualization, I aim to uncover patterns, differences, and trends in population dynamics, enabling a better understanding of the intricate factors driving population development worldwide.
