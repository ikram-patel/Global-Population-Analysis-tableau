<h1>GLOBAL POPULATION ANALYSIS</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
The primary objective was to shed light on the growth and spread of the global population by building interactive and visually appealing visualizations using Tableau. 
Over the course of history, there has been a significant increase in the global population, influenced by various factors such as migration trends, socioeconomic advancements, 
and mortality and birth rates. Through visualization, I aim to uncover patterns, differences, and trends in population dynamics, enabling a better understanding of the intricate factors driving population development worldwide.
